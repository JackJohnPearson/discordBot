FIRST: MAIN CODE IS PLACED IN "index.js"

SECOND: ".env" does not have the token to the original bot

THIRD: To run the bot I use nodemon on GitBash console in VSC

FOURTH: Using a function to join a voice chat will crash the bot, because it was hard-coded to join only on one specific server. 
Please change the "server.id" in the line 128 of "index.js" if necessary.

FIFTH:
Some other needed modules include: ffmpeg, yarn, discord.js, dotenv, pnpm, etc.
